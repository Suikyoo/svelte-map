# Todo

## Creator Routes

- ### Clean route endpoints
- Separate the point generation from the user plotted points for easier editing and deletion (shadow routes)

## User Pathfinding

- ### Create the "get_segment" algorithm. How much of a bus route is in the start-end route
- ### Create at least an in-memory data structure for the bus routes (fare, speed, etc)
- Create a visualization of the bus routes you'd take to reach the destination

## For both

When plotting the endpoints for the routes (start and end of routes including the user pinpoints), snap them to the mainroad. Keep the original points and add them in as a walk/motorcycle option.
